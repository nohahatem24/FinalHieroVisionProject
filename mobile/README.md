# Hierovision Flutter App

This is a Flutter application using GetX for state management. It is structured to mirror a typical React app, with clear separation of views, controllers, and routing.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## State Management
- [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) is used for routing, dependency injection, and state management.

## Project Structure
- `lib/main.dart`: App entry point and routing setup
- `lib/pages/`: Views/screens
- `lib/controllers/`: GetX controllers

## Customization
- Update or add pages and controllers as needed to match your React app's features.
