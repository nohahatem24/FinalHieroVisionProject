# 🏺 HieroVision – AI-Powered Hieroglyphics Translator & Learning App

**HieroVision** is an innovative graduation project that bridges the gap between modern technology and ancient Egyptian history. It combines the power of AI, mobile development, and cultural education to offer a smart platform that **recognizes, translates, and teaches ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics** to users of all ages – all from their smartphones or computers.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Before HieroVision, understanding hieroglyphs was extremely difficult:
- ❌ Most tools were academic, outdated, or hard to access.
- ❌ No user-friendly way to scan a symbol and understand its meaning instantly.
- ❌ Educational apps lacked cultural depth, interactivity, and AI assistance.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built **HieroVision** – a smart, AI-powered platform that:
- ✅ Instantly recognizes hieroglyphs from images and translates them.
- ✅ Offers English-to-hieroglyph translation.
- ✅ Provides educational content and cultural context.
- ✅ Supports kids through interactive games and learning.
- ✅ Allows users to explore landmarks, book visits, and chat with an AI guide.
